# HR-Diversity-And-Inclusion-Analysis
## Project Overview
This is the 4th BI task from a virtual internship at PwC through Forage. This dashboard is prepared for HR manager to see the employees overview of hiring, leaving, performance, promotions and what's the trend of working. 
Here is my proccess of building the Power BI Dashboard and some insights from it.

## Data Cleaning
Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in Power Query as follows:
- Removal of unnecessary columns:
  
```
= Table.RemoveColumns(#"Changed Type1",{"Rand", "Broad region group: nationality 1", "Time in Job Level @01.07.2020", "Job Level group PRA status", "Department & JL group PRA status", "FTE group"})
```

- Handle null values: The null values that were relevant to the analysis, especially in the Performance Rating columns were replaced with 0â€™s because they are numeric columns.
- Standardize data formats.
  
## Measures
### Leavers
- **Percentage of female employees leaved in 2020:**
```
%Women Leavers = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]),'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes",'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="female"),[Number of Leavers])
```

- **Number of employees leaved in 2020:**
```
Number of Leavers = CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]),'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes")
```

- **The percentage of employees leaved during 2020:**
```
Turnover Rate = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]),'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes"),DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),'Pharma Group AG'[In base group for turnover FY20]="Y")+CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),NOT('Pharma Group AG'[Department @01.07.2020]=BLANK())),2))
```

### New Hire
- **Percentage of employees were hired in 2020:**
```
% New Hire = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"),CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),ALLSELECTED('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?])))
```

- **Percentage of male employees were hired in 2020:**
```
%Men Hired = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y",'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="male"),CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"))
```

- **Percentage of female employees were hired in 2020:**
```
%Women Hired = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y",'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="female"),CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"))
```

### Promotion
- **Percentage of employees were promoted in 2020:**
```
%Employee Promoted FY20 = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY20?]="Y"),CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY20?]),ALLSELECTED('Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY20?])))
```

- **Percentage of employees were promoted in 2021:**
```
%Employee Promoted FY21 = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY21?]),'Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY21?]="Yes"),CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[In base group for Promotion FY21]),'Pharma Group AG'[In base group for Promotion FY21]="Yes"))
```

### Performance Rating
- **Average women' performance rating in 2020:**
```
Women Performance = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 Performance Rating]),'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="female")

```
Men Performance = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 Performance Rating]),'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="male")
