## Data Cleaning
Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in Power Query as follows:
- Handle missing values.
- Remove duplicates.
- Standardize data formats.
  
## Measures
### Leavers
- **Percentage of female employees leaved in 2020:**
```
%Women Leavers = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]),'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes",'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="female"),[Number of Leavers])
```

- **Number of employees leaved in 2020:**
```
Number of Leavers = CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]),'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes")
```

- **The percentage of employees leaved during 2020:**
```
Turnover Rate = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]),'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes"),DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),'Pharma Group AG'[In base group for turnover FY20]="Y")+CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),NOT('Pharma Group AG'[Department @01.07.2020]=BLANK())),2))
```

### New Hire
- **Percentage of employees were hired in 2020:**

% New Hire = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"),CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),ALLSELECTED('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?])))
```

```
%Men Hired = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y",'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="male"),CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"))
```

- **Percentage of female employees were hired in 2020:**
```
%Women Hired = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y",'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="female"),CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]),'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"))
```

### Promotion
- **Percentage of employees were promoted in 2020:**
